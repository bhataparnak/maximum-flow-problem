# maximum-flow-problem

Description:- C program that uses capacity scaling(delta) to solve the maximum flow problem. program outputs all augmenting
paths and also indicates any changes in delta(scaling parameter), and displays maximum flow obtained. This algorithm uses BFS method for graph traversal.
